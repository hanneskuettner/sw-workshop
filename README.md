# Service Workers Workshop

Hello Berlin DevFest 2016!

This is a platform that will allow us to get started with service workers and learn how to use them quickly.

## Running this locally

To run this locally, you will first need to install the dependencies.

```
npm install

// if you haven't used webpack-dev-server

npm i -g webpack-dev-server
```

Then run:

```
npm start
```

...and you're good to go!
